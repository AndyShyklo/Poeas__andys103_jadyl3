  - Chat with Mr. Dillon about scheduling algorithm:
    - Make algorithm to schedule students first
    - Add seating for course limitations 
    - Row of Student CSV data contains OSIS and course reqs
    - Row of Classes CSV data contains Course Code, Section #, Period, Seats, Room, Days
    - Elective rankings to be taken into account later
    - Use Recursion and possibly Stack object
    - May need to be rewritten in JS, if time allows (Google App Script)
    - Current uses 2D list, but can use 3D to read between student data in order to...
    - ... resolve impossible conflicts in schedules by shifting courses around through students <--- Goal

  - Made access methods for reading student and course CSV files
  - Created way to view impossible classes and existing course periods
  - Made new availability methods per student/class
  - Created sample data for student requests

  - Started assigning courses with simple, most selective classes-algorithm
  - Made course comparing function with dictionaries

  - Remade possible schedule algorithm and allows classes to be shifted upwards
  - Made code work for double period compatability (10 --> 0)
