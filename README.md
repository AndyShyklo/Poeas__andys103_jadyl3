## Description

“In this project, developers will write an algorithm that places students into course sections (aka a scheduling engine) based on the students need to graduate (requirements) and want to take (electives). Students will work with Mr. Dillon using anonymized Stuyvesant data. You'll learn some of the intricacies of the Program Offices/Registrar. This is not a feature that Talos currently has and would be used to  more effectively program students.” (Dillon, April 29th via DTM Piazza)

## Launch Codes

**Prerequisites**

Ensure that **Git** and **Python** are installed on your machine. It is recommended that you use a virtual machine when running this project to avoid any possible conflicts. For help, refer to the following documentation:
   1. Installing Git: https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git
   2. Installing Python: https://www.python.org/downloads/

### How to run

1. Create Python virtual environment

```
python3 -m venv PATH/TO/venv_name
```

2. Activate virtual environment

   - Linux: `. PATH/TO/venv_name/bin/activate`
   - Windows (PowerShell): `. .\PATH\TO\venv_name\Scripts\activate`

   - Type `deactivate` at anytime in the terminal to close a virtual environment

3. Navigate to project directory

```
cd PATH/TO/
```
4. Install dependencies (currently none)

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
5. Navigate to project app directory

```
 cd PATH/TO/
```

6. Run App

```
 python3 __init__.py
```
7. Open the link that appears in the terminal to be brought to the website
    - You can visit the link via several methods:
        - Control + Clicking on the link
        - Typing/Pasting http://127.0.0.1:5000 in any browser
    - To close the app, press control + C when in the terminal

```    
* Running on http://127.0.0.1:5000
